## Executive Summary
To implement an end-to-end online sales process, allowing customers to find, select, and purchase bikes through a web application (React frontend, FastAPI backend, PostgreSQL database).

## Problem Statement
Customers cannot buy our products online, which limits market reach and forces inefficient manual sales. We are losing potential revenue and customer convenience.

## Success Criteria
Achieve a >2% conversion rate, an average order value > $400, and a cart abandonment rate < 65% within three months of launch.

## User Stories
As a customer, I want to browse and filter bikes to find a model that fits my needs.

As a customer, I want to view detailed product pages with specs and images to make an informed decision.

As a customer, I want to add a bike to my cart and proceed to a simple checkout process to complete my purchase securely.

## Acceptance Criteria
Product filters must update the product list correctly.

The "Add to Cart" button must be disabled for out-of-stock items.

A successful order must redirect to a confirmation page and trigger a confirmation email to the user.

## Out of Scope
To be defined during implementation planning

## Technical Considerations
To be defined during technical design phase
